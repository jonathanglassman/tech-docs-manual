# Tech docs template

The Tech docs template is a [middleman][mm] [template][mmt] that
you can use to build technical documentation using a GOV.UK style.

![Screenshot of Example Documentation](images/composite.png)

The project consists of 3 repositories:

- [alphagov/tech-docs-template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template): the middleman site generator used to generate new sites
- [alphagov/tech-docs-gem](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem): the gem used by generated sites to include HTML, CSS and JS
- [alphagov/tech-docs-manual](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-manual): the repo that generates the documentation you're looking at now

[mm]: https://middlemanapp.com/
[mmt]: https://middlemanapp.com/advanced/project-templates

## Create a new site

You'll need [middleman][mm] installed, and its dependencies (Ruby). If you have Ruby v2.2.2 or newer installed you _should_ just be able to run `gem install middleman`. Installing or updating Ruby is outside the scope of this README.

From the command line run the following commands, substituting `my-new-project`
for the name of your new project:

```bash
middleman init my-new-project -T alphagov/tech-docs-template
```

This will run an interactive prompt where you can set basic configuration for
your project.

After installing, you can [further customise your site](#configuration-options).

## Update a site

If you want to upgrade to the latest version run the following:

```
bundle update govuk_tech_docs
```

This will make the site use the latest version of the [govuk_tech_docs gem](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem).

The [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) in the gem should tell you what changed.

## Configuration options

<%= gem_docs 'configuration.md' %>

## Frontmatter

<%= gem_docs 'frontmatter.md' %>

## Developing the template

### Local development

Refer to the [readme of tech-docs-template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template#local-development) if you intend to make changes to the generator.

Refer to the [readme of the gem](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem#developing-locally) if you intend to work on the gem.

## Deployment

One way to deploy your site is to use the [GOV.UK PaaS](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk).

To set up automatic deployment, create a file named `.travis.yml` with the following:

```yaml
# .travis.yml
language: ruby
cache: bundler
bundler_args: "--without development"
script: bundle exec middleman build
deploy:
  provider: cloudfoundry
  api: https://api.cloud.service.gov.uk
  username: <YOUR_PAAS_EMAIL_ADDRESS>
  password:
    secure: <YOUR_ENCRYPTED_PAAS_PASSWORD>
  organization: <YOUR_PAAS_ORGANISATION>
  space: <YOUR_PAAS_SPACE>
  on:
    repo: alphagov/<YOUR_REPO>
    branch: master
```

See the [GDS Way .travis.yml for an example](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-way/blob/master/.travis.yml).

You can encrypt your password by <INSERT MAGIC>.

In addition, you'll need a `manifest.yml` for the PaaS:

```yaml
# manifest.yml
---
applications:
- name: <YOUR_PAAS_APP_NAME>
  memory: 64M
  path: ./build
  buildpack: staticfile_buildpack
```
